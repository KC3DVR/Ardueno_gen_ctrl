# Ardueno_gen_ctrl
Arduino Generator Controler

I created this out of nisesity, we had a generator, and the transfer switch but no brains. 

The hang up are 
  1. im no software dev. so the code is cringe worthy at best
  2. there is no delay in the command going to the transfer switch as soon as the engein is runnign she goes.

if any one wants to ake a crack at makign this better have at it jsut share it here. 

Thanks
